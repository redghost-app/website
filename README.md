# About RedGhost.app

RedGhost.app is sort of like reddit but with social networks, with features such as blogging, friends system, status updates, private and public picture albums, forums, and more.

Eventually it'll be open to others creating and running their own communities. Currently it's under development.

## Built With

RedGhost.app uses no vite, no webpack, etc. It's purposely kept simple.

- Bootstrap 5 (Halfmoon variety - https://www.gethalfmoon.com/)
- Htmx (https://htmx.org/)
- Alpine.js (https://alpinejs.dev/)
- Signalr (for chat and notifications)
- .NET 8 (MVC + Razor Pages -- Blazor still has some major breaking flaws -- React, no need)
- MariaDB
- Redis

Also involved:

- Lots of monster energy drinks
- Some alcohol

## History

The social network design is inspired by my previous custom social network design that reached 500k members (2010-2014). Features are based on the design and communities can pick which features to enable for their community.
